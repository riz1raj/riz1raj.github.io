    <h1>Three Minutes Speech On Managerial Skills</h1><br><br>
    <p>
      Assalamualaikum to everyone. Hope you are doing well in this tough time.<br><br>
•	What is managerial skill?<br>
•	What are different kinds of managerial skills with examples?<br>
•	Which level of manager uses which skills?<br><br>
So, at first, Managerial skills are a kind of skill, by using these skills a manager fulfill some specific management tasks.<br>
Robert L Katz identifies three types of skills that are essential for a successful management process. They are-<br><br>
•	Technical skills<br>
•	Conceptual skills and<br>
•	Human skills<br><br>

•	Firstly, Technical Skills:<br><br>
Technical skills are closely related to the technical or engineering dimension of management. It is most important for first-level managers.<br>
•	For example- In a Software Company the Knowledge of Unix/Linux Operating System, Java/C++/Perl Programming Language, MySQL/Oracle Database Management, XML etc. are known as technical skills.<br><br>
•	Secondly, Conceptual Skills:<br><br>
Conceptual skills are a kind of ability of a manager for more abstract thinking. That means if a manager has proper conceptual skills, then he can easily analyze and diagnose of different problems in a company. Conceptual skills are vital for top managers, less critical for mid-level managers and not required for first-level managers.<br>
•	Example of conceptual skills are creativity, decision making, problem-solving, etc.<br><br>
•	At last, comes Human skill:<br><br>
Human skill is a manager’s ability to work with people. I think One of the most critical management tasks is to work with people. It is needed equally for all types of managers.<br>
•	Examples of human skills are effective communication (both verbal and written), motivating others, and rising team spirit etc.<br><br><br>

That’s all from my side. Thank you everyone.
