    <h1>Case Study on Engineering Ethics</h1><br><br>
    <p>
    <strong>  Case Study:</strong><br><br>

      Bangladesh started construction of its first nuclear power reactor, Rooppur 1, in November 2017. The unit is scheduled to be commissioned in 2023. The Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant will be a 2.4 GWe nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. The nuclear power plant is being constructed at Rooppur, adjoining Paksey, in the Ishwardi Upazila of Pabna District, on the bank of the river Padma, 87 miles west of Dhaka, in the northwest of the country. The country has a rapidly increasing power demand and is aiming to reduce its dependence on natural gas.<br><br>

      The ethical issues of nuclear energy focus on the comparison between the of benefits and the hazards of nuclear power, the catastrophic impact of nuclear accidents, fact disclosure, and safety regulations and violations. These issues have a great effect on global.<br><br>

      Briefly discuss the above case on “Moral Choices and Ethical Dilemmas” by identifying the relevant moral values and key concepts of it. Also, provide the options in resolving the Ethical Dilemma mentioned in the case and make a reasonable decision by weighing all the relevant moral reasons and facts.<br><br>

      <strong>  Answer:</strong><br><br>

      The Government of Bangladesh is building its first nuclear power plant in Rooppur on the east side of the river Padma near Ishwardi in the Pabna district of Bangladesh. The country’s first-ever nuclear power plant will have two power units -- each of 1,200MW capacities – which will be equipped with the latest Russian generation 3+ VVER-1200 reactor. Although, it has many harmful effects on the nature but it has some positive sides too, which can not be neglected.<br><br>

      To beign with, for this power plant people might cause health issues likes skin diseases for the locals, or in the case of natural calamities such as an earthquake, it might blow up altogether. Spread/slippage of radioactivity from the vessel area of NPP and from the uranium fuel or the waste (from NPP production) into the open can cause severe health and environmental hazards. This may occur, for example, due to faults in the NPP design and construction, human errors in operating and servicing the NPP, natural forces/disasters damaging the NPP or the waste repositories, accidents during transportation of the fuel and the waste. Some important observations from the history of the NPP incidents are as follows. First, despite extensive control measures, hazardous incidents do happen. Second, even with experience and sophisticated technologies, the frequency of hazardous incidents did not decline much over time. Third, even the most experienced, technologically advanced and rich countries experience such events and have enormous difficulty in managing a higher INES scale event, most amply illustrated by the 2011 Fukushima experience.[2] On the other hand, it is useful for the area and a power plant like this might give job opportunities to the people of the area. We will also get better electricity supply, which will be a great thing for us.[4]

      I am saying this is right because I think that this country needs a stable and powerful source which will be able to supply energy continuously for a very long period of time. From Here Nuclear Energy can be the best solution to this problem. Primary sources of energy can’t provide that much of energy as Nuclear Energy. Also the lifespan of a typical nuclear power plant is much higher than any other plant. To make a proper power generation master plan, it is required to make a proper speculation of the speed at which the demand is increasing. According to the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010, demand forecast made by Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh based on 7% GDP growth rate.[1]

      Here is a solution that can be looked. As safety is the significant question of nuclear power plants. After Fukusima accident the technology had been developed considering nuclear power plants problems, harmful factors and other phenomenon. Bangladesh decided to use VVIR-1200 Reactor. In this technology the possibility of accident is very low. The radioactive will not spared out into the air if accident happens. Those kinds of Power plants can control radioactive for 72 hours. People can shift in a safe place by this time. This is a third generation reactor. So, it is safer than the others. Moreover, nuclear power plants main concern is safety. Firstly, safety is being ensured. Besides, each steps of a nuclear power plant construction will go through under United Nations supervision. If United Nations nuclear department thought that it was safe then it can be marketed. They also examine the safety of this plant. This technology is better than the previous VVIR-1000 technology.[3]
      <br><br>

      I think the best option is VVIR-1200 Reactor. This technology is latest. Bangladesh shows their interest in a high-level meeting at Vietnam to use AIS-2006 power plant based on VVIR-1200 technology. Presently, NIAEP operates 39 power plants which are using the technology. This technology will be used in Bangladesh because it is new and the government demands this. The new technology is safer and as well as cost efficient. Booth, cost and security will be ensured by this new technology.[2]
      <br><br>

      In conclusion, Nuclear power plant offers clean electricity at a relatively low fuel and operating cost. However, deadly Nuclear power plant accidents do happen and can have severe health and ecological effects, especially in densely populated and agrarian countries. Many long-term Nuclear power plant using countries are also shifting toward alternative clean technologies. The power production in Bangladesh currently exceeds 4GW a year. The new plant will increase the country’s power production and enable it to achieve energy independence.
