    <h1>Case Study on Engineering Ethics</h1><br><br>
    <p>
      Why you think simple human contact is very important? <br><br>



      Through human contact the engineers realized that their efforts helped other people live and enjoy life. Hence, giving the engineers a feeling of accomplishment, which increased their motivation and morale. <br><br>



      What does it say about what motivated the engineers, both before and after the encounter? <br><br>

      Before the encounter, the motivation of the engineers was to solve technical issues that they were presented with in a more efficient manner than their competitors. <br><br>

      After the encounter and getting the first-person view of how their efforts improved people's lives, I personally think their motivation is to improve people's lives as it gives a much better sense of accomplishment. <br><br>



      Is the case too unique to permit generalizations to other engineering products? <br><br>



      I do not think the above-mentioned case is too unique. I think in all engineering products it is always good to understand what the consumers think and how this product will affect their lives and what they think can be done to improve the product. Communication between the consumer and the engineers helps both the consumers as they can freely express their concerns and also good for the engineers as they have a much clearer view of what it is that people want and how to improve their existing product. <br><br>



      P.S. All the above answers were compiled based on the paragraph given with the questions.
