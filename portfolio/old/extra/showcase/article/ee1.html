    <h1>Case Study on Engineering Ethics</h1><br><br>
    <p>
    <b> Case Study:</b><br><br>

      Hilary is an environmental engineer employed by the state environmental protection division. Pat, her supervisor, asks her to draw up a construction permit for a power plant at a manufacturing facility. Hilary is told by her supervisor to move quickly on the permit and "avoid any hang-ups" with respect to technical issues.<br>

      Hilary believes that the existing plans are inadequate to meet regulation requirements for air pollution standards (1990 Clean Air Act). As is, the facility would emit Sulphur dioxide and outside scrubbers are needed to reduce those emissions.<br>

      Knowing that suspension or revocation of her engineering license is a possibility if she prepares a permit that violates environmental regulations, Hilary tells Pat that she believes the plans would violate regulations and will not draw up a permit. Pat vehemently disagrees. He claims that mixing limestone with coal in a fluidized boiler process would remove 90% of the dioxide-- thus meeting the regulatory requirements.<br>

      The debate between Hilary and Pat was left unresolved. But one week later, Hilary learned that the department authorized the issuance of the permit.<br>

      What, if anything, should Hilary do now?<br>

      Identify, discuss and analyze following issues from the given case:<br><br>

      (a) What are the social and environment impact of the case?<br>

      (b) How do you access Hilary and Pat’s actions?<br>

      (c) What are Hilary’s engineering responsibility to public safety? How might these responsibilities be fulfilled simultaneously? Which takes precedence in case of confliction?<br>

      (d) Discuss the importance of Engineering Solution to support sustainable development.<br><br>

      DESCRIPTION<br><br>

      Hilary believes that the plant is exceptionally awful for the environment according to air pollution standards (1990 Clean Air Act). She needs to report this so it cannot be made, but her boss needs her to move fast. She doesn't write a permit, but she moreover doesn't report it. A week afterward, since she didn't report it, it does get a permit.<br><br>

      <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>

      A.<br>

      Environmental and social issues may manifest in many different ways and affect the viability of a financial institution's client/investee operations.<br>

      Environmental issues may present themselves as temporary or permanent changes to the atmosphere, water, and land due to human activities, which can result in impacts that may be either reversible or irreversible. Social issues may emerge in the workplace of a client’s/investee’s operations and may also impact surrounding communities. A client’s/investee’s performance in the areas listed below can represent environmental and social risks to the operation:<br><br>

      · Air emissions and air quality<br>

      · Energy use and conservation<br>

      · Wastewater and water quality<br>

      · Water use and conservation<br>

      · Hazardous materials use<br>

      · Wastes<br>

      · Land contamination<br>

      · Biodiversity and natural resources<br>

      · Labor and working conditions<br>

      · Occupational health and safety<br>

      · Community health, safety, and security<br>

      · Land acquisition and resettlement<br>

      · Indigenous peoples<br>

      · Cultural heritage<br><br>

      B.<br><br>

      I think Hilary ought to report the issue with Pat's control plant to the EPA. That’s what Hilary’s activity ought to be. They can decide whether his control plant ought to or ought to not get grants. Based on the NAAQS standard said over, the EPA needs to know whether certain plans for ventures are terrible for discuss quality. Moreover, based on a concept said over, in case she lets Pat construct his control plant whereas she knows it is hazardous for the environment, she ought to and will be penalized as well. On a greater scale than fair her work in spite of the fact that, Hilary ought to report it to assist the environment. It may be a truth that SO2 outflows are awful for the environment, and it can be seen in all the benchmarks that the EPA sets on SO2 outflows. By not announcing it, some person else is careless sufficient to allow Pat the licenses, so his plant gets to harmed the environment indeed in spite of the fact that she denied him licenses. That's what their activity ought to be. I don’t get to their activity within the right way.

      Hilary should follow these standards.<br>

      Standards for Environmental Engineering:<br><br>

      API PUBL 317: Usually a program/group that brings mindfulness to contamination avoidance. They are truly known to have effectively illustrate their bolster for contamination anticipation.<br>

      Clean Air Act (1970): This act directs air outflows from stationary and portable sources.<br>

      National Ambient Air Quality Standards: These guidelines were set by the EPA for toxins that were considered destructive and harmful to the public and the environment.<br>

      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): The Environmental Protection Agency is a federal government organization which was made for the reason of security human wellbeing and the environment by making rules and controls.<br>

      Pollution Prevention Act: This act set up a national arrangement that contamination should be anticipated or decreased at sources at whatever point attainable.<br>

      Inside Clean Air Act there are:<br>

      Protects people by setting standards to limit emission of certain pollutants<br>

      EPA set a limit on SO2 emissions for a days period to reduce pollution for human saftey<br>

      EPA set a limit on SO2 emissions for an annual average to protect public welfare<br>

      ALA (American Lung Association) set limits at smaller time intervals to prevent quick spikes in emissions of SO2<br>

      EPA set a limit on SO2 emissions for a one hour period to prevent small but large emissions<br>

      NAAQS Section 110(a)(2)(K) states that any prediction of the effects on the air quality by any of the 6 pollutants, SO2 in this case, must be submitted to EPA upon request.<br><br>

      D.<br>

      Development can be called the sum of our products and projects, i.e. our application of technology. In these applications engineers carry out, influence or decide the options evaluated, the decision-making criteria, the decision and the detailed design and implementation/production. For development to become ‘sustainable’, engineers must incorporate ‘sustainability’ into all our planning and engineering of products and projects. Technology is neither good nor bad in itself - how we choose to apply it determines whether a good balance is achieved.These steps helps to take decission about the Engineering Solution to support sustainable development.<br><br>

      ETHICAL DECISION STEPS:<br><br>

      1. Moral Clarity- It identifies the relevant moral values.<br>

      Here, the moral values are whether things should be complicated to make sure everything is safe for human health. Also, whether one should report unsafe actions despite the difficulties that may follow.<br><br>

      2. Conceptual clarity- It clarifies key concepts.<br>

      Pollution can lead to global warming and harm the lives of people all over the planet. Also, if somebody lets something illegal slide knowingly, they must also be held accountable.<br><br>

      3. Just the facts- It obtains all relevant information.<br>

      Hilary must issue a permit for a power plant without any issues. She knows that the sulfur dioxide emissions are too dangerous. If she issues a permit, she may be penalized for allowing the unsafe power plant to be created. Hilary does not report that the power plant is unsafe. The power plants ends up getting permits either way.<br><br>

      4. Informed about options- It considers all genuine options and alternative solutions.<br><br>

      One option is that Hilary can report Pat for his unsafe power plant. Another option is that she could listen to her boss and simply give out the permits just to make things easier. She could also propose a way that the problem of the sulfur dioxide emissions can be solved, so she can issue permits after a solution is found.<br><br>

      5. Well-reasoned- It helps to make a reasonable decision<br>

      After trying to reason with Pat and seeing that he will not fix his power plant, Hilary should simply report it to somebody so it needs to be fixed. This was, it would not get the permits that it gets a week later. This would protect the health of the people affected by the SO2 emissions, and ultimately help the planet.<br><br>

      CONCLUSION<br><br>

      Hilary should report the problem with Pat's power plant to the EPA. They can determine whether his power plant should or should not get permits. Based on the NAAQS standard mentioned above, the EPA wants to know whether certain plans for projects are bad for air quality. Also, based on a concept mentioned above, if she lets Pat build his power plant while she knows it is unsafe for the environment, she should and will be penalized as well. On a bigger scale than just her job though, Hilary should report it to help the environment. It is a fact that SO2 emissions are bad for the environment, and it can be seen in all the standards that the EPA sets on SO2 emissions. By not reporting it, somebody else is careless enough to give Pat the permits, so his plant gets to hurt the environment even though she denied him permits. This is why she should report it, because if she just denies him permits, he will find somebody else to give him some. She has to take into account her job and the environment, despite the pressure her boss puts on her.
