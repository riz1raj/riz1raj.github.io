<br><br>So, at first let’s discuss what is price?

<br><br>Price is the money charged for a good or service. For example, an item of clothing costs a certain amount of money. on the other hand, Price is also what a consumer must pay in order to receive a product or service.

<br><br>There are Four Orientations in Selecting an Approximate Price Level.
<br>1) demand-oriented approaches, 
<br>2) cost-oriented approaches, 
<br>3) profit-oriented approaches,
<br>4) competition-oriented approaches. 

<br><br>I will discuss about Demand orientation approach that involves the following pricing methods: They are-
<br><br>1. Skimming <br>2. Penetration <br>3. Prestige <br>4. Price lining <br>5. Odd-even <br>6. Demand- backward <br>7. Bundle

<br><br>At first comes……….

<br><br>Skimming Price 
<br>Here, Price is set to the highest initial price level that customers who really desire the product/service are willing to pay. Especially new or innovative products attract early buyers who believe that trying the product/service before the majority of the market is a privilege. The idea with skimming pricing is to take advantage of these price-insensitive buyers with the high price. As these customers' demand is satisfied, the firm might lower the price to attract another.
<br>Example: Nowadays, Space tourism companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin is attracting early buyers. Some agencies are selling tickets priced at $200,000 - $250,000 per person.    


<br><br>Penetration Pricing
<br>Penetration pricing is the opposite of skimming pricing. The firm sets the price low initially to appeal to the mass market. A firm applying penetration pricing may maintain the initial low price hoping that higher sales volume would generate higher profit. Penetration pricing is used to capture broader segments of the population.
Of course, the firm pays attention to controlling the costs, as cost matters when calculating profit. In some cases, penetration pricing follows skimming pricing. The initial high price helps attract price-insensitive consumers, which allows for covering initial research and development costs. After that, 

<br>Example: Amazon applied penetration pricing when they introduced the Amazon Fire tablet computer. The price was $199 while substitute products were priced at $499.


<br><br>Prestige Pricing
<br>Businesses set a high price so that quality- or status-conscious consumers will be attracted to the product and buy it. For products/services with prestige attachment, lower price would reduce their sales since consumers signal their status with using or consuming such products/services.
<br>Example: A car by Rolls-Royce, or mobile phone by Apple are attractive to status-conscious consumers.

<br><br>Price Lining Pricing
<br>Some firms sell not a single product but a line of products. It is called a price lining strategy when the firm prices the products at a number of different specific pricing points. Even though the cost of all of the items in the same product line might be the same, they are priced differently based on demand and preferences of consumers.
<br>Example: Apple, a smartphone manufacturer is a good example of price lining implementation. Apple offers its iPhone in a variety of price ranges and differing only by the presence of few additional features added to the higher-priced models. The price lining strategy is based on the demand from consumers.

<br><br>Odd-Even Pricing
<br>The price is set a few dollars or cents under an even number. It creates the illusion that the price is less than what it really is.
<br>Example: Smart phone prices is an extremely common example of odd even pricing. If we see brands like Xiaomi, Oppo etc., we will observe that they are all using even odd pricing to price their newly launched products. if the price is 15000 then they write it 14999/-.

<br><br>Demand Backward Pricing
<br>A pricing method in which an estimation is made of the price that customers are willing to pay for a given product; this price is then compared to the per unit cost to see if it meets the firm's profit objectives.
<br>Example: Flight prices fluctuate based on factors like timing and seasonality. So that, airlines typically charge higher prices for tickets from Dhaka to Rajshahi during EID holidays than they do during most other times of the year.

<br><br>Bundle Pricing
<br>
Bundle pricing means that two or more products are sold in a single "package" price. It helps the seller lower its marketing costs since marketing two products together as a single package cost less than marketing two products separately. These cost savings are often reflected to the buyers in the form of lower prices. It also helps consumers save time since they do not have to search for and book two products separately.
<br>Example: Like in our country, if a customer purchases new connection of AKASH DTH within campaign timeline and subscribed to Standard Package he will get additional 2-month subscription free and also our mobile phone operators offer different bundle packages that consists of Data pack with Minute and SMS bundle.

<br><br> Thats all from me, Thank You.
