    Assalamualaikum to everyone. I hope everyone is well in this tough time. My presentation topic is about inflation.<br><br>
    Today’s discussion topic is about ....<br><br>
    Inflation refers to a general progressive increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money.
    <br><br>
    •	Low inflation- Low inflation can be a signal of economic problems because it may be associated with weakness in the economy. When unemployment is high or consumer confidence low, (then these kinds of things can happen) people and businesses may be less willing to make investments and spend on consumption, and this lower demand keeps them from bidding up prices.
    <br><br>•	Galloping inflation- Galloping inflation (also jumping inflation) is one that develops at a rapid pace (dual or triple-digit annual rates) and that’s only for a brief period of time. Such form of inflation is dangerous for the economy as it mostly affects the middle and low-income classes of population.
    <br><br>•	Hyperinflation- Hyperinflation is out-of-control inflation, in which the price of goods and services rises at an annual rate of 1,000% or more. Hyperinflation can be caused by an oversupply of paper currency without a corresponding rise in the production of goods and services.
    <br><br>•	Demand-pull inflation- Demand-pull inflation is the upward pressure on prices that follows a shortage in supply, a condition that economists describe as "too many dollars chasing too few goods."
    <br><br>•	Cost-push inflation- Cost-push inflation occurs when the aggregate supply of goods and services decreases because of an increase in production costs. For instance, if low-paid workers in a factory form a union and demand higher wages, it's possible the factory owner will simply shut down the business in response.
    <br><br>•	Anticipated inflation- Anticipated inflation occurs when people know inflation is going to occur and prepare for it. For example, increased interest rates; if inflation is anticipated, banks can try and protect themselves by increasing the interest rates.
    <br><br>•	Unanticipated inflation- Unanticipated inflation occurs when people do not know inflation is going to occur until after the general price level increases. When this happens, many individuals are left unprotected, such as lenders who get paid back with a money that has a reduced purchasing power.
    <br><br> At last, These are the references from where I studied and collected data for presentation.
<br><br> Thats all from me, Thank You.
