    <h1>Case Study on Engineering Ethics</h1><br><br>
    <p>
You are a trainee accountant in your second year of training within a small practice. A more senior trainee has been on sick leave, and you are due to go on study leave. You have been told by your manager that, before you go on leave, you must complete some complicated reconciliation work. The deadline suggested appears unrealistic, given the complexity of the work.<br><br>

You feel that you are not sufficiently experienced to complete the work alone. You would need additional supervision to complete it to the required standard, and your manager appears unable to offer the necessary support. If you try to complete the work within the proposed timeframe but fail to meet the expected quality, you could face repercussions on your return from study leave. You feel slightly intimidated by your manager, and also feel pressure to do what you can for the practice in what are challenging times.<br><br>

Briefly discuss on:<br><br>

1. What are the Key moral principles affected?<br>

2. What are the relevant facts and who are the affected parties?<br>

3. Relevant options in resolving the Ethical Dilemma mentioned in the case.<br>

4. Reasonable decision by weighing all the relevant moral reasons and facts.<br><br>

<b>Case Study:</b><br><br>

1. A moral is the code of conduct that we develop over time and set for our self to follow, just like<br>

· Being good to everyone<br>

· Speaking only the truth<br>

· Going against what you know is wrong<br>

· Having chastity<br>

· Avoid cheating<br>

· Being a nice human being etc.<br><br>

As a good employee, it is my responsibility to ensure that I carry out my daily task at workplace with ethical behaviors. It is important for me to be honest and truthful to my manager and team members while maintaining good integrity at work. For this instance, I will have an honest and open discussion with my manager to explain to him that the work assigned to me is complicated and I do not have the sufficient experience to complete the work within the required timeframe. I will be transparent to him on my incompetency and highlight to him that I need guidance and supervision in order for me to be able to complete the work within a satisfactory standard.<br><br>

2. As an ethical employee, it is crucial for me to maintain transparency at work even when it involves disclosing difficult issues or admitting mistakes so that the problem can be deal with openly and objectively.<br><br>

It would be unethical to lie or hide my incompetency on this situation. If I try to attempt to complete the work by myself, I will risk missing the deadline and not meeting the expected quality. The consequences will not only be impacting my work performance but it will also be a burden to my manager or other team member for having to pick up and rectify my work at the very last minute. It may also cause potential damage or loss to the company for submitting poor quality work that is not meeting the client’s expectation. At last I can say that Me, Manager, Practice, Co-workers in practice and the Client will get affected by this.<br><br>

3. These are relevant options in resolving the Ethical Dilemma mentioned in the case are:<br><br>

1. Professional Competence: Whether I can able to complete the job without prfoper supervision and necessary support?<br>

2. Integrity: Whether I will be able to complete the job without required professional competence and supervision and meet the deadline and required output quality and meet Client demand and safeguard the firm's and self-reputation?<br>

3. Professional behaviour: Shall I refuse the job but this will go against my professional attitude and ethically wrong when my Employer is in problem.<br>

4. Transparency at work:- Shall I be open in discussing the issue with my boss and other personnel at the firm so that the critical situation can be dealt with best professional attitude and will not raise any conflict inside the firm or not breach the firm's commitment towards the client.<br><br>

One of the possible action can be taken to resolve the issues.

4. Most of the time, misunderstanding happens at workplace for not being open with one another. For this instance, I may assume that my manager refuse to help me because he just want to intimidate me and jump into a conclusion that he just want to discriminate me for my position which may not be the real case. On the other hand, if I did not voice out my challenges to my manager, he may assume that I have no issue on completing the task by myself and may not feel that the timeframe given to me is unrealistic. By being open and transparent with one another, we can both work out an effective plan to resolve the issue without jeopardizing the timeline and quality of work.<br><br>

Below are some of my alternative solutions which I will propose to my manager to resolve the issue:<br><br>

1) Extension of deadline<br><br>

· I will discuss and negotiate with my manager whether the deadline can be extended until I return from my study leave. If the deadline extension is possible, I can have more time to resolve the complicated reconciliation work to ensure that it meets a satisfactory standard.<br>

· I will also find out when my senior trainee will be returning from his sick leave and if it is within the timeline extension, I can seek for his help to guide me in completing the work.<br><br>

2) Seek help from other senior team members<br><br>

If the deadline extension is not possible, I would suggest to my manager that I would seek help from other senior team members who are able to guide me on the work. Although he (my manager) may be busy and not able to provide me with the support but he can assign another team member to work with me to complete the work.<br><br>

3) Exchange portfolio / project with other team member<br><br>

The other alternative is to discuss the option of exchanging portfolio / project with another team member. This work can be assigned to a more experience team member and in return I can take over his/her projects on hand which is within my capability. To be fair to the team member due to the complexity of this task, I will propose to take over a few of his/her projects in exchange with this complicated task.<br><br>
