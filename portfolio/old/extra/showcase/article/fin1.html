      Assalamualaikum to everyone. My presentation topic is about Risk and return.


    <br><br>  Risk and return
      <br><br>Risk is the chance of financial loss. Assets having greater chances of loss are viewed as riskier than those with lesser chances of loss. In other word it is defined as the variability of possible return from a project.

      <br><br>The Return is the total gain or loss experienced on an investment over a given period of time. It is commonly measured as cash distributions during the period plus the change in value, expressed as a percentage of the beginning-of-period investment value.

      <br><br>Diversifiable risk
      <br><br>The portion of an asset’s risk that is attributable to firm-specific, random causes; can be eliminated through diversification. Also called unsystematic risk.

      <br><br>Non diversifiable risk
      <br><br>The relevant portion of an asset’s risk attributable to market factors that affect all firms; cannot be eliminated through diversification. Also called systematic risk.
      The total risk of a security consists of no diversifiable and diversifiable risk.

      <br><br>In other sense risk may be defined in two types-

      <br><br>Financial risk
      <br><br>Business risk

      <br><br>Financial risk is the chance that investment will not generate cash flows to cover interest payment of money borrowed to finance it or principal repayments on the debt to provide to the firm.

    <br><br>  Business risk defined as the uncertainty in protection of future return on assets or on equity if the firm uses no debt.

    <br><br>  Measurement of risk 2 ways...

    <br><br>  Standard Deviation
      <br><br>Sigma k, which measures the dispersion around the expected value. The expected value of a return, k bar , is the most likely return on an asset.
    <br><br>  It is calculated as follows………

      <br><br>coefficient of variation (CV)
      <br><br>A measure of relative dispersion that is useful in comparing the risks of assets with differing expected returns.

  <br><br>    That’s all from me. Thank You.
