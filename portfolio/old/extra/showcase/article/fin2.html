      Assalamualaikum to everyone. My presentation topic is about Bond Valuation.

    <br><br>  So, at first comes What is bond?
    <br><br>  Bond is a commercial paper by which a company or government can collect money or fund from a market.
  <br><br>    The main characteristics of a bond are as follows:
  <br><br>    1.	Face value: The face value of a bond means which is written on a commercial paper that is called face value.
      For example: 1000, 2000 etc.

  <br><br>    2.	Coupon interest rate: The coupon interest rate means the rate of interest which will be paid by the bond seller to the bons holder.
      For example: 10% or 12% etc.

  <br><br>    3.	Maturity period: Maturity period means the time period for which a company or government sells bond to the bond holder.
      For example: 5yrs or 10yrs etc.
  <br><br>    4.	Interest payment period: It means the time for paying interest to the bond holder by the bond seller.
      Example: interest will be paid semi-annually or annually.

  <br><br>    Now comes Bond Valuation...

  <br><br>  Valuation is the process that links with risk and return to determine the worth of an asset. It is a relatively simple process that can be applied to expected streams of benefit from bonds, stocks, income property and so on. When it is measured the value of a bond that is called bond valuation.

  <br><br>    There are 3 key inputs of a bond valuation process.

  <br><br>    Cash Flows (Returns)--
      The value of any asset depends on the cash flow(s) it is expected to provide over the ownership periods. To have value, an asset does not have to provide an annual cash flow; it can provide an intermittent cash flow or even a single cash flow over the period.

  <br><br>    Timing--
      In addition to making cash flow estimates, we must know the timing of the cash flows.10 For example, Celia expects the cash flows of $2,000, $4,000, and $10,000 for the oil well to occur at the ends of years 1, 2, and 4, respectively. The combination of the cash flow and it’s timing fully defines the return expected from the asset.

  <br><br>    A measure of risk--
      The level of risk associated with a given cash flow can significantly affect its value. In general, the greater the risk of (or the less certain) a cash flow, the lower its value. Greater risk can be incorporated into a valuation analysis by using a higher required return or discount rate.


  <br><br>    The Basic Valuation Model
  <br><br>    Simply stated, the value of any asset is the present value of all future cash flows it
      is expected to provide over the relevant time period. The time period can be any
      length, even infinity.
    <br>  V0=value of the asset at time zero
    <br>  CFt= cash flow expected at the end of year t
    <br>  K=appropriate required return (discount rate)
    <br>  N=relevant time period

    <br><br>  Another formula…
    <br><br>  The basic model for the
      value, B0 where
    <br>  B0=value of the bond at time zero
    <br>  I=annual interest paid in dollars12
    <br>  N=number of years to maturity
      <br>M=par value in dollars
      <br>Kd=required return on a bond

    <br><br>  We can calculate bond value using Equation.

      <br><br>YTM
      <br><br>The rate of return that investors earn if they buy the bond at a specific price and hold it until maturity.
      The yield to maturity on a bond with a current price equal to its par value will always equal to the coupon interest rate.
      If the bond value differs from the par the ytm will differ from the coupon interest rate. In such situation ytm can be calculated precisely or approximated formula:

      <br><br>The formula is:
      …………………..

      <br><br>That’s all from me. Thank you all.
